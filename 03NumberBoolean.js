//practice 01 :
//Number datatype :
var value = 24;
console.log(value);
//here it is too obvious even if we dont use annotation 
//it will still be the same 
//this should be done when you are in a team and others keeps changing 
//so inorder to let them know you can use annotation like :
//practice 02 :
var value1 = "eswar";
//uncomment and see :
/*value1 = 12;*/
console.log(value1);
//when you assign a value the datatype of the value is given to it 
//so we cannot change the value of other datatype
//uncomment and see :
//so it is unnecessary to write annotation and is obvious writing
//like example 3
//practice 3
var value2 = 13;
value2 = 12;
console.log(value2);
//similarly when using number methods it is obvious we dont need
//the usage of annotation
//practice 04
var value3 = 13.344;
value3.toFixed();
console.log(value3);
//this will be enough
var value4 = 13.344;
value4.toFixed();
console.log(value4);
