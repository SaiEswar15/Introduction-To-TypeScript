//practice 1
var employeeName = "eswar";
//generally we write variable like this but to be specific
//about the datatype we should use TS
//practice 2
var ownerName = "kumar";
console.log(ownerName);
//it consoles fine 
//but if any other developer working on your code 
//he might change it and may give a number 
//like :
//practice 3 :
//uncomment and see this :
/*ownerName = 45;
console.log(ownerName);*/
//this gives you an error 
//but if you execute the js your output will be 45
//uncomment and try executing both ts and js you will find out
//similarly we can see this in number and boolean also
var number1 = 12;
//uncomment and see
/*number1 = "eswar";*/
console.log(number1);
